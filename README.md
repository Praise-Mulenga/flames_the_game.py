flames_the_game.py
The program is a simple game called flames. It basically allows a user to enter their name and another name of a person of their choice, and then analyses the two names by noting identical letters in the names and subtracting them from each name, then summing up all unidentical letters of the two names so that the program can determine if the users are either friends, lovers, admirer's, enemies or intimate mates with the other person (name) of their selection.
